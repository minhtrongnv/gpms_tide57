# Compose: many charts, one chart

The compositor builds (or loads) the ownership partition over its charts'
embedded coverage, then offers the SAME output set as a single chart, composed:
any tile on demand for the cost of a classify plus one decompress or one
decode/clip, plus the composed view outputs and the composed cursor pick. It
**borrows** the charts — their mmap'd archives and decoded coverage — so the
chart set is never fully resident and the charts must outlive the compositor.
Open once, serve many, close.

The per-surface forms above (`_png` / `_pdf` / `_canvas` / `_surface` / `_labels`,
plus `tile57_compose_gpu_scene`) are the composed twins of the single-chart
[render surfaces](./render.md#render-surfaces) — same parameters, same callbacks,
same ownership, over the whole set instead of one archive.
