# Rendering Engine

tile57 contains a full **native S-52 rendering engine**: it draws a finished
chart — raster PNG or vector PDF — straight from ENC charts, with no MapLibre,
browser, or GPU involved. This page explains how it works, how to use it, and
how to extend it.

> Drawing the chart on a GPU instead? That has its own contract — draw-ready
> buffers, the uniform block the shaders read, the shaders themselves, and a
> batcher that turns ranges into draw calls. See
> [GPU Rendering](./gpu-rendering.md).

## The one-paragraph version

Charts are turned into **draw calls**. The *scene generator* reads charts, runs
the official S-101 portrayal rules, and calls methods like `fillArea("DEPVS",
rings)` or `drawSymbol("BOYLAT13", point)` on a **Surface**. What happens next
depends on which Surface is listening: the tile surface *serializes* those
calls into MVT/MLT tiles for a MapLibre client to draw later; the pixel
surface *resolves* them (color tokens → RGB, symbol names → vector outlines)
and paints them onto a **Canvas** — a raster canvas for PNG, a PDF canvas for
print. One engine, pluggable outputs.

                                       → PNG                → PDF (real text objects)
```

Two interfaces do all the work:

- **Surface** (`src/render/surface.zig`) — the *semantic* interface. Calls carry
  S-52 meaning: color **tokens** like `DEPVS`, symbol **names** like
  `BOYLAT13`, raw sounding depths, S-52 metadata (drawing priority, display
  category, SCAMIN). Nothing is resolved yet. This is what lets the tile
  surface emit *re-styleable* tiles — a MapLibre client can switch day/night
  palettes or the safety contour without re-baking, because the tiles still
  contain the names, not the pixels.

- **Canvas** (`src/render/canvas.zig`) — the *drawing* interface. By the time a
  call reaches a Canvas, everything is resolved: RGB colors, flattened
  polygon outlines, positioned glyphs. A Canvas knows nothing about charts.
  This is deliberately the same shape as a classic 2-D drawing API, so a new
  output format is one small file.

Between them sits the **PixelSurface**, written once and shared by every
pixel format. It does the genuinely chart-aware work:

- the **resolver** (`src/render/resolve.zig`) turns color tokens into RGB at
  the chosen palette and evaluates the mariner's display gates — display
  category, SCAMIN scale gating, viewing groups, text groups — *live*, at
  render time, from real settings;
- **symbols** replay the official catalogue SVGs as vector outlines
  (`src/render/symbols.zig` + the nanosvg-backed store in `src/sprite/`) —
  no bitmap blitting, crisp at any scale;
- **soundings** are composed digit-by-digit from the same SNDFRM04 routine
  the tile path uses, at the mariner's *actual* safety depth and display
  unit;
- **text** is shaped with a from-scratch TrueType reader
  (`src/render/font.zig`, embedded Noto Sans) and decluttered over the whole
  scene — higher drawing priority wins, exactly like a real ECDIS;
- everything is buffered, sorted into S-52 paint order (areas → patterns →
  lines → symbols → soundings → text), and painted through the Canvas.

The **PDF canvas** deserves a note: labels become *real PDF text objects*
(the font is embedded, with a ToUnicode map), so the output is selectable,
searchable, and print-sharp — not a picture of text. Both outputs are
byte-deterministic: the same scene renders the same file, every time.

### Why the mariner settings matter more here

The tile path has to **freeze** the portrayal context at bake time (a tile
archive can't re-run Lua per user), and papers over it with swappable
properties the style toggles at runtime. The pixel path evaluates the
mariner's display gates — palette, display category, SCAMIN, viewing groups,
text groups, size scale — live at render time for any source. Rendering a
live chart (the CLI on a `.000`, or `Chart.openBytes` in Zig) goes further:
the S-101 rules themselves run with the mariner's *actual* safety contour,
boundary style, and point-symbol style — what you see is what the rules
decided for *your* settings, the ECDIS-faithful path. Rendering a baked
archive replays its tiles, so the rule outcomes are the bake's; the
swappable parts re-evaluate.

## Using it

### From the command line

```sh
# One tile of a chart, as a 512px PNG
tile57 png US5MD1MC.000 14 4712 6280 -o tile.png --size 512

# A view (any centre, fractional zoom, any size) from a single chart
tile57 png US5MD1MC.000 --view -76.48,38.974,15.1 --size 1600x1200 -o annapolis.png

# The same view as a vector PDF with selectable text
tile57 pdf US5MD1MC.000 --view -76.48,38.974,15.1 --size 1600x1200 -o annapolis.pdf

# From a baked PMTiles bundle instead of the source chart (tile replay)
tile57 png chart.pmtiles --view -76.48,38.974,15.1 --size 1024x768 -o out.png

# Mariner settings
tile57 png ... --safety 5 --safety-depth 5 --feet --palette night \
               --no-names --language zho --plain --simplified --dq --scale 1.5
```

### From C (and therefore Go, Python, C++, …)

Everything is bake, then render: open a baked archive as a chart and ask it
for a view (same allocate-`*out` / free-with-`tile57_free` convention as the
rest of the ABI):

```c
tile57_chart *c = NULL;
tile57_chart_open("US5MD1MC.pmtiles", &c, NULL);   /* a baked archive */

tile57_mariner m;
tile57_mariner_defaults(&m);
m.safety_contour = 5.0;
m.scheme = TILE57_SCHEME_NIGHT;

uint8_t *png; size_t len;
tile57_chart_png(c, -76.48, 38.974, 15.1, 1600, 1200, &m, &png, &len, NULL);
/* ... write/display png ... */
tile57_free(png);

uint8_t *pdf; size_t plen;
tile57_chart_pdf(c, -76.48, 38.974, 15.1, 1600, 1200, &m, &pdf, &plen, NULL);
```

That renders ONE chart, no composition. A view across a whole chart library
is the same call on the compositor — `tile57_compose_png` / `_pdf` — which
composes every covering tile through the ownership partition first. See
[Compose](./api/compose.md).

`m.size_scale` calibrates physical size (so 1 S-52 millimetre is a true
millimetre on your display). Every field of `tile57_mariner` — categories, text
groups, contours, units — evaluates live.

HiDPI is a separate input, `m.device_scale`: the device pixels per reference
pixel your framebuffer has. `size_scale` is the mariner's size preference,
`device_scale` is the display's density, and the two multiply. The pixel outputs
ignore it — there the engine rasterizes at the width and height you asked for, so
the density is already stated. It matters on the **surface** paths, where the
engine sizes text and symbols in reference px and *you* draw them: a host that
draws at 2x without saying so gets collision boxes sized for glyphs half the size
it paints, and a view the engine decluttered cleanly arrives on screen
overlapping.

### From Zig

Both interfaces are directly available: build a `PixelSurface`, drive it with
`scene.generateTile` / `scene.generateView`, or replay a decoded tile with
`scene.replayTile`. See `tools/bake.zig`'s `runRender` for a complete worked
example. For the higher-level `Chart` entry points — `renderView` (PNG / PDF /
canvas), `renderSurfaceView`, and `renderGpuScene` — see the
[Zig API render page](./zig/render.md#render-surfaces).

## Extending it

**A new output format = one Canvas implementation.** Implement four methods
(`fillPath`, `strokePath`, `fillPattern`, `drawGlyphRun`) over your target —
an SVG writer, a framebuffer blitter, a plotter driver — and every chart
feature, symbol, and label arrives already resolved and positioned.
`src/render/pdf.zig` (~350 lines) is the model to copy.

**A new tile/serialization format = one Surface implementation.** Implement
the ten Surface methods and you receive the full semantic stream — this is
how MVT and MLT are done (`TileSurface` in `src/scene/scene.zig`), and how a
GeoJSON debug dump or a GPU display list would be done.

**From the C ABI:** the same engine is exposed three ways, all in S-52 paint order
— see [Render surfaces](./api/render.md#render-surfaces) for the full contract:

- `tile57_chart_canvas` drives a `tile57_canvas_cb` — resolved, flattened paths,
  patterns, and glyph outlines in **pixel** space (the Canvas seat).
- `tile57_chart_surface` drives a `tile57_surface_cb` — the **world-space**,
  semantically tagged stream (per-feature class + SCAMIN, world anchors,
  reference-pixel outlines) a GPU host tessellates once and transforms per frame
  (the Surface seat).
- `tile57_chart_gpu_scene` hands back **draw-ready GPU buffers** — already
  triangulated, already in paint order, already batched into one-pipeline ranges —
  so a GPU host does no tessellation and owns no copy of the S-52 ordering rules.

The two callback seats arrive already sorted (areas → patterns → lines → symbols →
soundings → text, by draw priority within each class), so drawing in callback order
is correct and no host needs its own sort — but only an order you *preserve*
survives. A GPU host that batches by draw type to cut pipeline switches reorders the
stream and breaks paint order; the fix is to batch by `display_priority` **band**
(not by pipeline, and *not* by sorting each per-type batch), drawing the bands in
ascending order. That rule is documented in full on the C API page:
[Paint order](./api/render.md#paint-order). The
[draw-ready GPU scene](./api/render.md#draw-ready-gpu-scenes-batched-buffers)
sidesteps it entirely — its ranges *are* the order, so drawing them in sequence is
all a host does.

The two text callbacks also carry the label's S-52 text group, so a host can draw
group 11 (important text) larger or bold and ordinary names normally — that group
belongs to the label, not the feature. All three seats have composed twins on the
compositor (`tile57_compose_canvas` / `_surface` / `_gpu_scene`). A custom output
format in Zig is still one small file in `src/render/`.

For a tile-renderer host that caches geometry per tile (via the per-tile
`tile57_chart_tile_surface`), a companion `tile57_chart_labels`
(`tile57_compose_labels` on the compositor) emits **only** the view's text —
resolved against one collision pool across every covering tile, so labels no
longer collide or repeat at tile seams the way the per-tile pass leaves them.
It reuses the same `tile57_surface_cb` text callbacks and world anchors and draws
no geometry, so the host paints cached tiles then overlays this decluttered text
last. Each covering tile's label candidates memoize on the chart (or compositor),
so only the first view of a region portrays: a pan, zoom or rotation over tiles
already seen re-resolves the cached candidates against the new view instead.

## What's deliberately not here (yet)

- Contour labels render horizontal (not rotated along the line).
- No kerning (chart labels are short; Noto's advances read fine).
- Translucent fills print opaque in PDF.
- Archive replay doesn't overzoom past the baked range (the compositor serves
  one fill-up zoom past it).
- The PDF embeds the whole label font (~600 KB) rather than a subset.
