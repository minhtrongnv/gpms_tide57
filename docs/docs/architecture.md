# Architecture

This page explains how tile57 turns an ENC chart — a *cell*, in the spec's
vocabulary — into vector tiles, how the codebase is layered, and the memory
design that keeps it small.

## The pipeline

A chart flows through these stages, all inside the engine. Both source formats
converge on the same S-101 feature + attribute records — a native S-101 dataset
produces them directly; an S-57 chart is adapted into them:

```
S-101 ENC (.000)          S-57 ENC cell (.000)
   │ decode 8211             │ decode 8211            src/iso8211/  (iso8211)
   ▼                         ▼
S-100 spatial + feature   S-57 feature + geometry     src/s57/      (s57)
   records                   model
   │ assemble to the         │ adapt S-57 → S-101      src/s101/ native.zig
   │ S-101 model             │ features                          / adapter.zig
   └───────────┬─────────────┘
               ▼
S-101 feature + attribute records
   │  apply S-101 portrayal           src/portray/ + embedded Lua 5.4
   ▼                            (vendor/S-101_Portrayal-Catalogue)
portrayal instruction stream
   │  parse the instruction stream    src/s101/ instructions.zig
   ▼
scene generation                      src/scene/  (project + clip + draw calls)
   ▼
render Surface                        src/render/surface.zig
   ├─► tile surfaces:  MVT / MLT encode + PMTiles    src/tiles/
   │        + MapLibre style.json + portrayal assets src/style/, src/sprite/
   └─► pixel surfaces: PNG raster · vector PDF · terminal text (src/render/)
```

1. **Decode (ISO 8211).** Both S-101 and S-57 charts use the ISO 8211 binary
   container format; the decoder reads its raw records and fields. The chart
   format is detected from the file's own record schema.
2. **Build the S-101 model.** A native S-101 dataset (S-100 Part 10a) is read
   straight into S-101 feature + attribute records — its own in-band code tables
   already carry the S-101 class and attribute names, and its complex attributes
   are explicit, so no conversion is needed. An S-57 chart instead builds the
   S-57 feature + geometry model (depth areas, buoys, coastlines, …) and adapts
   it into the same S-101 records. Geometry (assembled from the vector topology)
   and attributes become a queryable in-memory model either way.
3. **Apply S-101 portrayal.** The official IHO S-101 Portrayal Catalogue — the
   real Lua rule files — runs in embedded Lua 5.4 and decides how to draw each
   feature: symbol, colour, line style, conditional symbology. Zig implements the
   `Host*` query callbacks the rules call back into (plus a small C shim, since
   Lua's macros are easiest from C).
4. **Adapt the instructions.** The portrayal output is turned into simple drawing
   primitives: filled polygons, stroked lines, symbols, patterns, soundings, text.
5. **Generate the scene.** Each primitive is projected to web-mercator tile
   coordinates, clipped (extent 4096, buffer 64), and emitted as *draw calls* on a
   **Surface** — the backend contract described below.

### The Surface contract

Every output format implements one vtable — `Surface`
(`src/render/surface.zig`). The engine emits *semantic* draw calls (S-52 colour
tokens, symbol names, raw depths, per-feature display metadata); what happens
next depends on the listening backend: the **tile surface** serializes the
semantics into MVT/MLT tiles for a client renderer, the **pixel surface**
resolves them (tokens → RGB, symbol names → vector outlines) and paints PNG
raster or deterministic vector PDF, and the **ASCII surface** lowers them to a
Unicode terminal grid (with optional ANSI colour, or real pixels inline via the
kitty graphics protocol). One engine, pluggable outputs — see
[Rendering Engine](./rendering.md).

### Tile formats: MLT by default, MVT optional

Bakes encode **MLT** ([MapLibre Tile](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec))
by default; MapLibre GL JS ≥ 5.12 decodes it natively via the vector source
`encoding` option, and the generated styles carry that hint. The engine can also
encode Mapbox Vector Tiles for consumers without an MLT decoder.
`tile57_info.tile_type` reports which encoding a chart's tiles use, so a
host hints its renderer correctly.

### Band handoff (coverage-clipped ownership)

Overlapping charts of different compilation scales are resolved per tile to
the best band. Rather than *carry* a coarser chart's features down into a finer
band's tiles (the old `smax`-tagged carry-down), the compositor clips each
chart to the **ownership partition**: at every tile the finer chart's M_COVR
coverage wins the ground it holds, and a coarser chart renders only where no
finer chart covers it.
Band boundaries hand off without holes or double-draws, and there is no
per-feature handoff tag for the style to gate.

### Overscale indication (`oscl`)

Per S-52 §10.1.10, every contributing chart's coverage polygon is baked as an
`OVERSC01` vertical-line hatch tagged `oscl` = the chart's compilation-scale
denominator. The hatch shows only while the display is *finer* than `1:oscl`,
and the style sandwiches it between the overscaled and at-scale fill passes so
finer opaque data occludes a coarser chart's hatch. The `show_overscale`
mariner toggle (default on) drives its visibility.

## The Zig modules

The stages are separate Zig modules (see `build.zig`), most of them pure (no
libc/Lua) and target-agnostic:

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `iso8211` | the ISO/IEC 8211 container reader (the bottom layer; std-only) |
| `s57` | the S-57 chart parser + geometry model (reads 8211 records through `iso8211`) |
| `s101` | the S-101 catalogue, the native S-101 dataset reader, the S-57 → S-101 adapter, and the portrayal instruction stream |
| `portray` | the embedded-Lua S-101 runner (links libc) |
| `tiles` | MVT + MLT encoders, gzip, the PMTiles container, web-mercator tile math |
| `render` | the Surface contract, the resolver (colours, display gates), and the pixel machinery (Canvas, PNG, PDF, ASCII) |
| `scene` | S-57 → tile-surface scene generation + the banded ENC_ROOT baker (`bake_enc.zig`) |
| `style` | the S-101 color tables and line styles, the MapLibre style.json layer set, and the S-52 `mariner` settings model (`mariner.zig`) |
| `sprite` | the S-101 sprite + area-fill pattern atlases from the catalogue Symbols/AreaFills (SVG raster; links libc) |

The `style` and `sprite` modules generate the S-101/S-52 portrayal assets — color
tables, line styles, sprites, and patterns — from the S-101 Portrayal Catalogue.
They read the catalogue bytes as input rather than importing `s101`, so they stay
independent modules a caller can grab on their own.
| `engine` | the pure packages re-exported as one import (the test root) |
| `tile57` | the curated public surface (`src/tile57.zig`) |

`portray` and `sprite` are the only modules that link libc, and neither is
imported by the pure test build. The C ABI (`src/capi.zig`) is a thin shim over
the same Zig API as the `tile57` module.

## The layering: chart / compose / style

The public surface composes the packages into high-level entry points:

- **`Chart`** — ONE open chart, no composition. Open a baked **PMTiles** archive
  (`openPmtilesPath`, mmap'd; `openBytes`) or a live chart (`openBytes` on `.000`
  bytes), then take its outputs: view renders (`renderView` — PNG, PDF, or a
  callback canvas; `renderSurfaceView` — world-space GPU callbacks), the cursor
  pick (`queryPoint`), the metadata getters, and — for an archive — its stored
  tiles verbatim through `pmtilesReader()`. In the C ABI: `tile57_chart_tile` /
  `tile57_chart_png` / `tile57_chart_pdf` / `tile57_chart_canvas` / `tile57_chart_surface` /
  `tile57_chart_query`. A streaming ENC_ROOT open (`openPath` / `openCharts` /
  `openChartsStreaming`) is the metadata + extraction view of raw source data
  (the C `tile57_enc_*` readers); it serves no tiles or renders.
- **Tile production** — bake each chart to its own PMTiles at its compilation scale
  (`tile57_bake_chart_bytes`, which runs the banded bake engine `scene/bake_enc.zig`
  on a single chart), then a runtime **compositor** stitches the overlapping charts
  through an ownership partition and offers the SAME outputs as a chart, composed:
  `tile57_compose_tile` for any `(z, x, y)` on demand, `tile57_compose_png` /
  `_pdf` / `_canvas` / `_surface` / `_query` for composed views and the composed
  pick. Baking is strictly per-chart: one chart, one archive.
- **`style.build`** (`style/maplibre.zig`) + **`style`** / **`sprite`** —
  generate the MapLibre style and the portrayal assets it references
  (`tile57_style_build` / `tile57_bake_assets` in the C ABI).

## The memory design

tile57 is built to hold only its working set:

- **Lazy per-chart reads.** An ENC_ROOT is opened by scanning each chart's
  header for a cheap spatial index (band + bbox). A chart's bytes are read and
  parsed
  only when a metadata or feature query needs them, then released under an LRU
  bound.
- **Ownership, not overlays.** Overlapping charts of different compilation
  scales are resolved by the precomputed ownership partition — each tile's
  ground belongs to exactly one chart per band, so composing never loads every
  overlapping chart.
- **Streaming open.** `openChartsStreaming` (and its on-disk driver `openPath`,
  which backs the C `tile57_enc_*` readers) take per-chart metadata (bbox +
  scale) plus a reader; a chart's bytes are read only on demand and freed on
  eviction. A
  host then holds only the working set's bytes, not the whole catalogue — the
  right choice for a large ENC_ROOT.
- **Per-chart bakes.** Each chart bakes independently at its own compilation
  scale, so a bake holds a single chart's parsed data at a time — memory
  doesn't grow with the size of the catalogue.
- **Tile cache.** Generated/decoded tiles are memoized per chart (keyed
  `z<<48 | x<<24 | y`) and released with the chart, so a long-running host bounds
  memory by closing charts it no longer renders.

## The live-composite bake

One `bake` command (`tile57 bake <cell.000 | ENC_ROOT | chart.KAP | BSB_ROOT> -o out/`) writes the
live-composite structure — per-chart tiles plus the ownership partition a runtime
compositor serves them from:

```
out/
  tiles/US5MD1MC.pmtiles    one PMTiles per chart, baked at its compilation scale
  tiles/US4MD81M.pmtiles       (M_COVR coverage embedded in each archive's metadata)
  partition.tpart           the ownership partition: which chart renders which ground
```

There is no merged archive: any `(z, x, y)` tile is composed from the overlapping
charts on demand (`tile57_compose_tile`), so re-baking one chart doesn't
rewrite the whole ENC_ROOT. The portrayal assets are generated separately (`tile57 assets` /
`style`); the tiles carry S-52 colour **tokens**, never RGB, and both halves come
from the *same* S-101 catalogue, so they cannot drift. The tile-schema vocabulary
(`tile57/2`) is the contract a renderer checks.

See the [**Tile Schema**](./tile-schema.md) for the vector-tile layer contract.
