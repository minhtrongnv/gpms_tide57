# tile57

:::warning Not for navigation

This is not a certified or tested navigation product. **Do not rely on it for
real-world navigation.** See [Known limitations](./limitations.md).

:::

**tile57** is a nautical chart engine. It reads both native IHO **S-101** ENC
charts — the S-100-based successor format hydrographic offices are beginning to
publish — and legacy IHO **S-57** ENC cells (each cell is one electronic
navigational chart, compiled for one scale; NOAA and others publish thousands).
The format is detected from the chart file: a native S-101 dataset feeds the
portrayal model directly, while an S-57 chart is first converted to the S-101
data model — a best-effort step, since S-57 has no perfect S-101 translation
(see [Known limitations](./limitations.md)). Either way, tile57 runs the
official IHO **S-101 Portrayal Catalogue** in embedded Lua to decide how each
feature is drawn, producing **S-101 symbology** (the successor to S-52).

The primary output is **vector tiles**, fetched by `(z, x, y)`:
[MapLibre Tiles](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec) (MLT, the
default) or Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT). Alongside the tiles, tile57 emits the
matching **MapLibre GL style** and the portrayal **assets** it references —
colour tables, line styles, and the sprite and area-fill pattern atlases — so
a renderer such as [MapLibre](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native)
draws a complete chart from tile57's output alone.

tile57 also contains a [native S-52 rendering engine](./rendering.md): the same
scene that becomes tiles can be drawn straight to **PNG**, deterministic vector
**PDF**, or a **terminal** (Unicode grid / kitty graphics), with the mariner's
display settings evaluated live — no browser or GPU involved.

The whole engine is one **Zig** library behind a **C ABI**, with **Go**
bindings in the repo; it compiles natively (Linux, macOS, Windows) or to
**WASM**.

## The pipeline

```
S-57 ENC cell (.000)
   │  ISO 8211 decode                    src/iso8211/
   ▼
S-57 feature + geometry model            src/s57/
   │  adapt S-57 → S-101 features        src/s101/ (adapter)
   ▼
S-101 feature records
   │  S-101 portrayal (embedded Lua)     src/portray/ + rules
   ▼
portrayal instruction stream             src/s101/ (instructions)
   │  scene generation                   src/scene/  (project + clip + draw calls)
   ▼
render Surface ──► MVT / MLT tiles + PMTiles (src/tiles/)  +  MapLibre style.json + assets
             └───► PNG raster / vector PDF / terminal text (src/render/)
```

This is the flow for one chart. The organizing principle is **bake, then
compose**: each source chart bakes once to its own PMTiles archive, and every
output — a served tile, a PNG, a query — is produced from baked archives, with
overlapping charts stitched into one on demand by the
[runtime compositor](./architecture.md).

## The memory model

The engine holds only its working set:

- **Lazy, per-chart reads.** A multi-chart ENC_ROOT is indexed cheaply (band
  + bbox); a **streaming** open reads a chart's bytes only when a metadata or
  feature query needs them (and frees them on eviction), so a host holds only
  the working set — not the whole catalogue.
- **Per-chart bakes, composed on demand.** Each chart bakes to its own
  PMTiles at its compilation scale, so a bake holds one chart at a time; the
  runtime compositor mmaps the archives and stitches the charts by `(z, x, y)`
  on demand through an ownership partition, so serving never loads the chart
  set either.
- **Pure-Zig core.** The foundational format/encode modules (`iso8211`, `s57`,
  `s101`, `tiles`, `render`, `scene`, `style`) have no libc; only the Lua
  portrayal (`portray`) and the sprite rasterizer (`sprite`) pull in C.

## Portrayal

tile57 runs the official IHO **S-101 Portrayal Catalogue** — the real Lua rule
files — in embedded Lua 5.4. The tiles carry S-52 colour **tokens** (never RGB),
and the generated `colortables.json` resolves those tokens to Day / Dusk / Night
hex, so a renderer can switch palette without regenerating tiles.

## Where to go next

- [**Installation**](./installation.md) — Zig 0.16, submodules, `zig build`.
- [**Getting Started**](./getting-started.md) — bake charts and fetch a tile
  from Zig or C.
- [**The CLI**](./cli.md) — `tile57` bake / render / inspect commands.
- [**Zig API**](./zig-api.md) — the `@import("tile57")` surface.
- [**C API**](./c-api.md) — the `tile57_*` C ABI (`include/tile57.h`).
- [**Architecture**](./architecture.md) — the pipeline and the Zig packages.
- [**Tile Schema**](./tile-schema.md) — the vector-tile layer contract.
- [**Rendering Engine**](./rendering.md) — the native S-52 pixel path: PNG/PDF
  renders, the Surface/Canvas architecture, and how to extend it.
- [**GPU Rendering**](./gpu-rendering.md) — draw-ready buffers, the uniform block,
  the shaders and the batcher: what a 60 fps chartplotter host actually needs.
- [**Known Limitations**](./limitations.md) — what does not render yet.
