//! Coverage-clipped best-available partition — the first-stage planar partition of
//! the cross-band chart composition. "The finest cell whose M_COVR(CATCOV=1) covers
//! a point owns that
//! ground; every other cell is clipped away there." This module turns a set of
//! ENC cells (each carrying a compilation scale, a band-eligibility floor, and
//! coverage rings) into, per **zoom tier**, one `owned` region per cell — a
//! seamless planar partition with no overlap and no gap.
//!
//! The partition is **per-tier**, not once-per-bake: because a harbour cell is
//! not drawn below its band floor, "which cells are in the pool" depends on the
//! zoom. Computing ownership once would open a permanent blank window over every
//! basin owned by a below-floor fine cell (the HOLES blocker); recomputing per
//! distinct floor (≤6 tiers) closes it geometrically.
//!
//! Everything runs on integer coordinates via `boolean.Pt` (i64): coverage is
//! stored as degrees × 10⁷, so seams that adjacent cells digitised independently
//! round to the same integers before any boolean runs.
//! All set algebra goes through `boolean` (Martinez, overlap-typed, deterministic).
//!
//! Scope: this computes and validates the partition, the tile classifier
//! (FULL / EMPTY / SEAM), and the coverage line clips. The S-57 adapter (filling
//! `Cell` from an `s57.Cell`, incl. the cscl≤0 and date-order tie-break policy)
//! lives with the consumers; `Cell` is deliberately decoupled so this stays pure
//! and unit-testable.
