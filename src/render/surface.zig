//! Render engine Surface contract — the vtable every output format implements.

//! The engine calls these methods with geometry already projected into the

//! preserved (color tokens, symbol names, scamin) so tile surfaces (MVT/MLT)
//! can serialize them for clients that re-style without re-baking; pixel
//! surfaces resolve them through a shared lowering layer.
//!
//! Rule: surfaces must NOT import s57, s101, or portray. If a surface needs a
//! fact the calls don't carry, that's an engine bug — extend the contract.
