//! VectorSurface — the Surface implementation for GPU vector embedders.
//!
//! The sibling of PixelSurface: it RESOLVES the same S-52 semantics (token->RGBA,
//! symbol name->outline, text->glyph outlines, the non-SCAMIN display gates) but,
//! instead of baking everything into one pixel frame, emits a WORLD-SPACE tagged
//! stream to a C callback so a GPU host can transform geometry and pin symbols/
//! text at a constant screen size — no re-portrayal per pan/zoom.
//!
//! Differences from PixelSurface, and why:
//!   * Area/line geometry is emitted in web-mercator WORLD coords ([0,1], y down)
//!     — the host applies its own view transform each frame. Needs the tile
//!     (z,x,y) to unproject tile-space; set via setTile before each tile.
//!   * Point symbols and text are emitted as a WORLD anchor + a LOCAL outline in
//!     reference px (device scale fixed at 1x, NOT the view's px_per_tile) — so
//!     the host draws them at a fixed screen size at the projected anchor.
//!   * SCAMIN is NOT gated here; it is passed through per feature so the host can
//!     cull per frame. Category / viewing-group / text-group / point / boundary
//!     gates DO apply (they track mariner settings, not zoom). We evaluate the
//!     combined gate at a high zoom so only SCAMIN is neutralised.
//!   * Draw calls are BUFFERED and sorted into S-52 paint order at endScene, the
//!     same class-major rule PixelSurface paints by (see OpLayer), so a host that
//!     draws in callback order is correct without re-sorting. The engine walks
//!     tile by tile, so only the finished scene can be ordered. Labels are held
//!     back for a second reason as well — which label SURVIVES cannot be known
//!     until the whole scene is walked and the collision pool is resolved.
//!     Callback order only survives to the screen if the host preserves it: a
//!     host that batches by draw type must sort its own batches by `display_priority`.
