//! The Canvas: the PRIMITIVE drawing seam of the render engine — the
//! pixel-side counterpart of the semantic Surface. The pixel surface resolves
//! S-52 semantics (render_resolve: token -> RGB, display gates) and paints
//! through this interface, so a new pixel format is one new Canvas
//! implementation (RasterCanvas now; a PDF canvas later) and the resolver /
//! layout code is never rewritten.
//!
//! Mirrors the original Go RenderSurface (chartplotter-original pkg/s52render):
//! resolved colors and flattened geometry only — no S-52 tokens, symbol names,
//! or catalogue knowledge below this line.
//!
//! Geometry arrives fully transformed into the canvas's pixel space (y down).
//! P2 scope is fills + strokes; pattern fills (P3) and glyph runs (P4) extend
//! the vtable when their phases land.
