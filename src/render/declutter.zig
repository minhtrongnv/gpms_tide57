//! Label declutter — the ONE collision authority.
//!
//! Every surface (pixel, ascii, vector) resolves a crowded chart through this
//! module, and the tile style's collision keys are generated from the same
//! ladder, so a chart declutters the same way whichever backend draws it.
//!
//! The S-52 model this encodes:
//!
//!   * ONLY TEXT COMPETES — at chart scale. A sounding is a SYMBOL — the
//!     Presentation Library draws soundings as symbol glyphs precisely so they
//!     stay legible and correctly located — and every symbol must be drawn:
//!     S-52 defines suppression only for coincident LINES and area boundaries,
//!     never for symbols. So a symbol (sounding included) neither drops a
//!     label nor is dropped by one; text is drawn last, on top of it. That
//!     rule is scoped to content displayed WITHIN its usage band's window,
//!     which is the only display S-52 governs. Below the window — a
//!     harbour-band symbol overscaled to an overview zoom, ground S-52 would
//!     never put it on — unmanaged overplot buries the chart, so FILL-DOWN
//!     symbols enter a pool of their own (addSymbol): they compete only with
//!     each other, never with or against text, display base never enters at
//!     all, and an uncontested symbol always draws.
//!
//!   * RANK. Text carries a text group, and the groups split into IMPORTANT
//!     text (10-19) and Other text (everything else) — the one text ranking
//!     S-52 draws, and the split the mariner's own "Important Text" / "Other
//!     Text" selection rides on. Important text claims its space first.
//!
//!     That is the WHOLE ladder. There is no second axis to rank text by:
//!     every label carries display priority 8 — text is drawn last, at a fixed
//!     priority, "independent of the object it applies to" — so a label's
//!     feature draw priority says nothing about the label, and ranking on it
//!     would invent an order the spec does not have.
//!
//!   * TIES. Two labels of the same tier are peers, and S-52 calls for "the
//!     given sequence in the data structure of the SENC, or some other neutral
//!     criterion" to settle the arbitrary decision: the earlier-emitted label
//!     wins, the engine's emission order being that sequence.
//!
//! The pool also settles REPETITION, which collision alone cannot. The engine
//! walks a scene tile by tile and clips each feature to the tile it is drawn in,
//! so one island, one depth contour, one sea area spanning several tiles is
//! labelled once PER TILE — each copy anchored to its own clipped piece, so the
//! copies never overlap and a collision test happily keeps them all. That is the
//! "Rhode Island" printed six times, the 9 m contour printed forty-eight. S-52
//! wants text kept to what the mariner needs to read: a feature is labelled, not
//! labelled repeatedly because of how we cut the tiles. So a label also loses if
//! the SAME text is already placed within `repeat_px` of it — the spacing below
//! which a repeat is redundant rather than informative. A long contour still
//! carries its value again further along, which is what a chart wants.
//!
//! What the pool deliberately does NOT do is let placement fall out of the
//! order the engine happened to walk the cell. Every candidate is RANKED
//! before any of them claims space. That is the whole point: a light
//! description must not vanish because some other feature — a sounding, a
//! buoy name — was encoded ahead of it, and toggling an unrelated display
//! setting must never change which labels survive.
