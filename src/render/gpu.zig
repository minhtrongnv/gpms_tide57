//! GpuSurface: the Surface implementation that emits DRAW-READY BUFFERS — the
//! fourth output alongside pixel (raster/PDF), ascii and vector (callbacks).
//!
//!   Surface calls ─► resolver (token->RGB @ palette, display gates @ zoom)
//!                ─► op buffer ─► endScene: sort by paint order, tessellate,
//!                                pack ─► {vertices, indices, ranges}
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. A GPU host must batch by pipeline, which destroys the order
//! the engine emitted in, so it has to rebuild paint order itself. Handing it
//! only the callback stream meant every host also grew: a tessellator, a vertex
//! packer, a copy of the class taxonomy, and a copy of the S-52 ordering rule.
//! That is a scene — a second one, drifting from this one. The same spec bug
//! (applying OVERRADAR precedence with no radar overlay) had to be found and
//! fixed twice because of it.
//!
//! So the engine hands over geometry that is already triangulated, already in
//! paint order, and already split into ranges a host can draw one pipeline at a
//! time. The host uploads and draws. It owns no scene and knows no S-52.
//!
//! WHAT THE HOST STILL OWNS: the camera, the shaders, and the decision of what
//! to do with `local` offsets and `scamin` — those are per-frame, and baking
//! them here would force a rebuild on every zoom.
