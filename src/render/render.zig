//! The render engine's shared contracts and pixel machinery, one module:
//!
//!   surface  — the SEMANTIC seam every output format implements (color
//!              tokens, symbol names, S-52 meta). MVT/MLT serialize these
//!              verbatim; pixel surfaces resolve them.
//!   noop     — the discard surface (engine-only benchmarking).
//!   resolve  — the resolver: token -> RGB at a palette + the mariner display
//!              gates, mirroring the live MapLibre style semantics.
//!   canvas   — the PRIMITIVE seam pixel surfaces paint through (resolved
//!              colors + flattened geometry only; ≈ the original Go
//!              RenderSurface). One new pixel format = one new Canvas.
//!   raster   — RasterCanvas: scanline-AA software rasterizer (RGBA8).
//!   png      — RGBA8 -> PNG (re-exported from `tiles`, where the picture-tile
//!              codec lives; same name, same calls).
//!   pixel    — PixelSurface: the resolve-and-draw Surface implementation
//!              (buffers ops, sorts by display_priority, paints through a Canvas).
//!   ascii    — AsciiSurface: the chart as a Unicode text grid (optional
//!              ANSI-256 color). The worked example of adding a backend.
//!   declutter— the label collision authority EVERY surface resolves through,
//!              so a crowded chart declutters the same way on all of them.
//!
//! Rule: nothing in this module imports s57, s101, or portray. If a surface
//! needs a fact the Surface calls don't carry, that's an engine bug — extend
//! the contract, never back-channel.
