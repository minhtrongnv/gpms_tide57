port an algorithm from another project, or embed third-party data, add it here in
the same change (see the polylabel entry as the worked example).

## Vendored libraries (compiled into the binary)

| Library | Version | Where | License |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lua | 5.4.7 | `vendor/lua/` | MIT (© 1994–2024 Lua.org, PUC-Rio) |
| SQLite | 3.50.4 | `vendor/sqlite/` | public domain |
| nanosvg | 2013–14 (Mikko Mononen) | `vendor/nanosvg/` | zlib |
| stb_image_write | v1.16 (Sean Barrett) | `vendor/stb/` | public domain (MIT alternative) |
| Noto Sans Regular | 2026.05.01 (Google) | `vendor/fonts/NotoSans-Regular.ttf` | SIL Open Font License 1.1 |
| Noto Sans Bold | 2.000 (Google) | `vendor/fonts/NotoSans-Bold.ttf` | SIL Open Font License 1.1 |
| Noto Sans Italic | 2.000 (Google) | `vendor/fonts/NotoSans-Italic.ttf` | SIL Open Font License 1.1 |
| wasi-libc (sjlj runtime) | wasi-libc as bundled with Zig 0.16 | `src/portray/wasm_sjlj_rt.c` | Apache-2.0 / MIT (dual) |

- **Lua** is built from source and driven through `src/portray/lua_shim.c` to run
  the S-101 portrayal rules engine.
- **nanosvg** rasterizes the S-101 SVG symbols into the sprite atlas; it embeds
  Anti-Grain Geometry rasterizer math by Maxim Shemanarev (also permissive).
- **Noto Sans** (Regular, Bold, Italic) is `@embedFile`'d into the binary as the
  render engine's label faces — the label-tier resolver (`src/render/labeltier.zig`)
  picks bold for populated-place names and italic for hydrography. Glyph outlines
  are parsed by `src/render/font.zig`, a from-scratch TrueType outline reader — no
  font library is vendored.
- **stb_image_write** writes the PNG sprite atlases.
- **SQLite** reads MBTiles raster charts (`src/raster/mbtiles.zig`) where the
  mariner left them. Built read-only from the amalgamation; see `addSqlite` in
  build.zig for the trimmed feature set. The authors have dedicated it to the
  public domain — no attribution is required, and this entry is a courtesy.
- **wasi-libc sjlj runtime**: the wasm engine build (`zig build wasm-engine`)
  compiles Lua's and libtess2's setjmp/longjmp error paths through clang's
  wasm sjlj lowering, and `src/portray/wasm_sjlj_rt.c` is the runtime that
  lowering calls into — a verbatim copy of wasi-libc's
  `libc-top-half/musl/src/setjmp/wasm32/rt.c` (the file's header comment
  states why it must be vendored). wasi-libc is dual-licensed Apache-2.0 /
  MIT; the license texts ship with Zig under `lib/libc/wasi/`.

`vendor/lua/LICENSE.html` carries Lua's full notice; the nanosvg, stb and SQLite
licenses are in the headers themselves.

## Ported algorithms

### polylabel (pole of inaccessibility)

The area "representative point" search in `src/s57/s57.zig`
(`areaRepresentativePoint` and its `PlCell` quad-tree refinement) is a port of the
Mapbox **polylabel** algorithm.

## IHO S-101 Portrayal Catalogue and Feature Catalogue

> **License status: to be confirmed.** Treat this as a known open item, not a
> cleared right to redistribute. **Unlike the Go reference** (which `.gitignore`s the
> catalogue and embeds it only in opt-in `_s101` release builds), this repository
> tracks the catalogue as **git submodules** and **embeds it into the default
> `tile57` binary** at build time (`embedDir` in `build.zig`). This repository
> therefore *does* redistribute IHO material — both as submodule references and in
> the built binary — so confirming the rights is more pressing here.

tile57 portrays charts using the **IHO S-101 Portrayal Catalogue** and **Feature
Catalogue** (symbols, color profiles, drawing rules, line styles, area fills, and
feature definitions). These materials are **© the International Hydrographic
Organization (IHO)**.

Source repositories (public, but **no license declared** — all rights reserved):

- Portrayal Catalogue — <https://github.com/iho-ohi/S-101_Portrayal-Catalogue>
  (`vendor/S-101_Portrayal-Catalogue`)
- Feature Catalogue — <https://github.com/iho-ohi/S-101-Documentation-and-FC>
  (`vendor/S-101-Documentation-and-FC`)

Embedded at build time via `embedDir` (`build.zig`): `Rules/*.lua`, `Symbols/*.svg`
+ `*.css`, `LineStyles/*.xml`, `AreaFills/*.xml`, `ColorProfiles/*.xml`. The
`--rules` / `--catalog` flags (and env overrides) can point at an external copy
instead. The IHO copyright and reproduction policy is at <https://iho.int>.

## Derived data

`vendor/s101/catalogue.json` and `vendor/s101/s57codes.json` are distilled from the
IHO Feature Catalogue and the **IHO S-57 Object & Attribute Catalogue** (the object
and attribute acronyms — `ADMARE`, `DEPARE`, …). They carry the same IHO-origin
caveat as the catalogue above. (The same S-57 acronym/code table is distributed in
machine-readable form by the **GDAL** project under MIT/X11.)

## Web demo assets (dev only — not part of the shipped library)

These live under `bindings/js/examples/web/` and `test/` and are used only by the
MapLibre GL JS demo; they are not linked into or embedded by the tile57 library.

| Asset | Where | License |

## Reference data read at runtime (not redistributed in this repo)

**NOAA ENC** S-57 cells: NOAA charts are works of the U.S. Government and are in the
**public domain**, carrying NOAA's standard disclaimer — the data is **not to be
used for navigation**.

## Formats and standards implemented (no third-party code copied)

- **PMTiles** archive format — Protomaps (BSD-3-Clause spec).
- **Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT)** spec — Mapbox.
- **MapLibre Tile (MLT)** spec — MapLibre (spec/documentation CC0-1.0). The
  MLT codec (`src/tiles/mlt.zig`) was written with the reference
  implementations in github.com/maplibre/maplibre-tile-spec as the wire-format
  reference (the Java encoder's stream/metadata layout; the Rust `mlt-core`
  crate as the conformance reference) — that code is dual-licensed
  **MIT / Apache-2.0**. No reference-implementation code is copied or ported
  into this repo; if any ever is, it must gain a full attribution entry above
  with the license text.
- **IHO S-100 / S-101 / S-57 / S-52** standards — IHO.
