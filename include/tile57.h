/* tile57.h — public C ABI for libtile57.
 *
 * libtile57 is an embeddable nautical-chart engine. It reads IHO S-57 ENC
 * charts (each one a *cell*, in the spec's vocabulary), bakes them to per-chart
 * PMTiles archives, serves composed vector tiles from
 * those archives on demand, renders finished charts to pixels / PDF / a callback
 * surface, and generates the matching S-52 MapLibre style + portrayal assets.
 *
 * Everything is BAKE, THEN COMPOSE (or bake, then render): source charts bake
 * once to per-chart archives; every output — a tile, a PNG, a PDF, a callback
 * stream — is produced from baked archives. The header is organised the same
 * way:
 *
 *   3. BAKE     ENC source data in, per-chart PMTiles out. Each chart bakes to
 *               its own archive at its own compilation scale, with its M_COVR
 *               coverage + scale embedded in the archive metadata. This is the
 *               import step; the section also carries the raw-source readers
 *               (chart inventory, feature extraction, exchange-set catalogue).
 *
 *   4. RENDER   a `tile57_chart` handle opens ONE baked archive (mmap'd from a
 *               path, or copied from bytes) and answers for it with NO
 *               composition: metadata (info / scamin / coverage), its stored
 *               tiles verbatim (tile57_chart_tile — the primitive for writing your
 *               own compositor), the cursor pick (query), and view outputs
 *               (png / pdf / canvas / surface).
 *
 *   5. COMPOSE  a `tile57_compose` handle stitches MANY open charts through the
 *               ownership partition and offers the SAME output set,
 *               composed: tile (what a live tile server hands its HTTP layer),
 *               png, pdf, canvas, surface, query.
 *
 * Section 6 (style + portrayal assets) turns the mariner's S-52 display options
 * into a concrete MapLibre style JSON plus the colortables / sprite / pattern /
 * glyph atlases it references. The composed tiles are MapLibre Tiles (MLT);
 * maplibre-gl >= 5.12 decodes them natively via the vector source `encoding`
 * option. The ABI is renderer-agnostic.
 *
 * Errors: every call that can fail returns a tile57_status (TILE57_OK = 0) and takes
 *   an optional caller-owned tile57_error* it fills on failure — see section 2.
 *   Out-parameters are always defined on return: the result on TILE57_OK,
 *   NULL/0 otherwise. "Nothing produced" is NOT a failure — a call that finds
 *   nothing (a chart that bakes no tiles, a tile nobody owns, a chart with no
 *   SCAMIN values) returns TILE57_OK with a NULL/zero out.
 *
 * Lifetime: a handle must OUTLIVE every borrower still holding it: a compositor
 *   borrows its charts (close the compositor first, then the charts), and in
 *   the MapLibre hosts a long-lived source captures the handle and intentionally
 *   never closes it before process exit (closing first would be a use-after-free
 *   during teardown). A path-opened chart mmaps its file — the file must stay in
 *   place while the chart is open.
 *
 * Threading: no handle is internally synchronized — do not call into the SAME
 *   handle from multiple threads concurrently (caches are mutated without a
 *   lock). A compositor reads through its charts, so while it serves, do not
 *   call those charts' own methods from other threads. Distinct handles are
 *   independent.
 *
 * Memory: calls that return bytes allocate *out; release it with
 *   tile57_free(ptr) — buffers are length-prefixed at allocation, so the
 *   pointer is all it needs. All pointers are POD across the ABI.
 *
 * The S-101 portrayal self-test / bring-up entry points live in a separate
 * header, tile57_diag.h (developer tooling, not part of the embedding API).
